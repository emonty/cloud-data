OpenStack Cloud Data
====================

Data files containing information about default values as well as per-vendor
information that is useful to know when attempting to interact with an
OpenStack cloud.

The data is currently consumed by `os-client-config` but is separated out so
that it does not wind up only being consumed by python.
